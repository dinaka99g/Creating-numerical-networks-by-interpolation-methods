# Creating-numerical-networks-by-interpolation-methods

Using a program written in the Python programming language, generate a structured 
network using transfinite interpolation for the following cases:

1. the computational domain lies within the square defined by points (0,0), (5,5), (0,10) and (-5,5), and
   he grid has 10 cells along each side of the square,
2. the computational domain lies within a quadrilateral defined by equal lengths between points (5,0), 
(10,0), (15,5) and (0,5), and the grid has 10 cells along each side of the quadrilateral,
3. the computational domain lies within the circle defined by the following arcs moving in the direction counterclockwise:
   - arc between points (0,0) and (10,0), with center at point (5,5),
   - arc between points (10,0) and (10,10), with center at point (5,5),
   - o arc between points (10,10) and (0,10), with center at point (5,5),
   - o arc between points (0,10) and (0,0), with center at point (5,5),
   - and the network has 10 cells along each arc.

 4. the computational domain lies within the domain defined by the following lines:
    -the length between points (0,0) and (10,0), o the arc between points (10,10) and (10, 0) moving counterclockwise on           clock, with center in point (15.5)
    - a broken line between points (10.10) and (0.10), whose breaking point has coordinates (5.15),
    - the arc between points (0,0) and (0,10) moving counterclockwise, with the center at point -5,5), and the network has           10 cells along each side of the domain (considering the broken line as one side),
    
 5. the computational domain lies within the domain defined by the following lines:
     - arc between points (5,0) and (0,0) counterclockwise, with center in points (2.5,-2.5)
     - arc starting from point (5.0) to (5.5) counterclockwise, with center in points (7.5,2.5)
     - arc between points (0,5) and (5,5) counterclockwise, with center in points (2.5,7.5)
     - o broken line between points (0,5) and (0, 0), with breaking points coordinates (2.5, 2.5),
